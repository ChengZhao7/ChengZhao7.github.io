PERSONAL STATEMENT 
I am currently conducting research on the impact of ElNiño on the spread of biomass burning in Indonesia. My research
combines satellite data and Python programming to reveal that El Niño affects soil moisture in peatlands during the
dry season, which can lead to major fire events. I have a BSc in Environmental Science from Gannan Normal University.
There, I developed cost-effective online monitoring spectrometers and honed my laboratory skills in developing
absorbing materials for VOCs and using spectrometers. I am looking for a suitable PhD position to further study the
health effects of air pollutants.

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
Impact of El Niño on the spread of biomass burning in Indonesia 
Supervisor: Dr. Jim McQuaid & Dr. Ailish Graham December 2023 – September 2024
▪ Analyzed the correlation between fire occurrences and El Niño using NASA FRIM fire data.
▪ Quantified the impact of El Niño on peatlands with SMAP satellite data, identifying a significant increase in fire risk 
during El Niño years.
▪ Presented findings at the ICAS research seminar, receiving positive feedback and suggestions for further exploration.
Development of a spectral instrument for rapid online detection of atmospheric pollutants (Final year projects)
Supervisor: Dr. Yuhan He September 2022-May 2023 
▪ Developed a low-cost fiber optic spectrometer for laboratory use, achieving a spectral resolution of <3nm.
▪ Validated the spectrometer with MATLAB, ensuring an error rate of <0.1%, demonstrating reliability for industrial 
exhaust gas monitoring.
▪ Implemented the instrument in industrial settings, reducing monitoring costs by 20%.
